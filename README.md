# marantz-control
A server that lets you send commands to your Marantz (and apparently Denon). 
The receiver control is pinched from https://github.com/ntotten/marantz-avr and lightly refactored. Targeting zones 2 and 3 has also been added

The idea of this repo is to create a webhook that IFTTT can POST to so i can control the receiver with Google Assistant
